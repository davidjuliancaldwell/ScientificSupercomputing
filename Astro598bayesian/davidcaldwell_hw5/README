TITLE:
  This is the README for assignment #5 for astro 598 bayesian statistics

SYNOPSIS:
  In the provided folder is the python script to be run on hyak (hw4_script.py),
  the module and functions called by the script (bayesian_functions_hw4.py), as
  well as the plots (posterior_theta_figure.png) generated by the code

  In order to run this on Hyak, first obtain an interactive session with X11
  forwarding
  > qsub -I -V

  Load anaconda via
  > module load anaconda3_4.2

  Run the script
  > python ./hw5_script.py

  Limitations: very small likelihood values requires manipulation of the Decimal
  module in python to handle the numbers without underflow. Matplotlib is unable
  to visualize the very small likelihood values for M = 10000 points to be read
  in on a linear scale, requiring a conversion of the likelihood to be log
  likelihood (monotonic function with log, so it reaches a peak value in the
  same place)
  
  Requirements: Python 3, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy, Decimal

README ANSWERS:

  See figures for plots (Of note, for M = 10000, it is a log y axis plot, as
  the tolerances on matplotlib were unable to effectively visualize the
  very low probabilities)

  b) The problem with this prior that has zero probability at values of
  theta is that this restricts the likelihood from ever being non-zero at any
  of these values of theta. In the case of overwhelming evidence towards
  even a very small theta value, with enough data the likelihood could move
  the most probable value. If the prior is zero there however, the likelihood
  will never be able to move to that point

  e) as the number of data points used to compute the likelihood increases, the
  choice of prior becomes less impactful on the overall posterior distribution,
  and the most likely value for theta approaches 0.1
