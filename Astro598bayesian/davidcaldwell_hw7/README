TITLE:
  This is the README for assignment #7 for astro 598 bayesian statistics

SYNOPSIS:
  In the provided folder is the python script to be run on hyak (hw7_script.py),
  the module and functions called by the script (bayesian_functions_hw7.py), as
  well as the plots generated by the code

  In order to run this on Hyak, first obtain an interactive session with X11
  forwarding
  > qsub -I -V

  Load anaconda via
  > module load anaconda3_4.2

  Run the script
  > python ./hw7_script.py

  Limitations: The decimal calculations and likelihood calculations are very
  slow, and take a long time to run.

  Requirements: Python 3, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy

README ANSWERS:

  See figures for plots

  (e).
  N is large enough for 10000 to converge to the appropriate values
  with a delta of 0.1

  (f).
  N = 10000, mu = 1.97966, sigma = 0.979159
  N = 100000, mu = 1.99453, sigma = 0.982731
  N = 1000000
  Distribution , mu = 2, sigma = 1

  (g).
  N = 10000, mu = 2.10018, sigma = 1.11212
  N = 100000, mu = 1.9985, sigma = 0.99770
  N = 1000000
  Distribution , mu = 2, sigma = 1

  (h).
  N = 10000, mu_1 = 1.9356832, mu_2 = 3.66755
  N = 100000, mu_1 = 19.325, mu_2 = 2.05656
