TITLE:
  This is the README for assignment #3 for astro 598 bayesian statistics

SYNOPSIS:
  In the provided folder is the python script to be run on hyak (hw3_script.py),
  the module and functions called by the script (bayesian_functions.py), as
  well as the plots (posterior_theta_figure.png) generated by the code

  In order to run this on Hyak, first obtain an interactive session with X11
  forwarding
  > qsub -I -V

  Load anaconda via
  > module load anaconda3_4.2

  Run the script
  > python ./hw3_script.py

  Limitations: Small likelihood values
  Requirements: Python 3, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy

  EXAMPLE OUTPUT WHEN RUN ON HYAK
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  When kposter(theta,y) is a maximum, theta = 0.131313131313
  Theta 1 = 0.0909090909091, Theta 2 = 0.222222222222
  The mean of theta is 0.500000000000005, the standard deviation of theta is 0.29157646512864027
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

README ANSWERS:

part b) MAP estimate for theta is 0.1313

part d) theta_1 = 0.091, theta_2 = 0.222

part f) mean of theta = 0.5, standard deviation = 0.292
