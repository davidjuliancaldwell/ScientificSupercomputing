TITLE:
  This is the README for assignment #2 for astro 598 bayesian statistics

SYNOPSIS:
  In the provided folder is the python script to be run on hyak (hw2_script.py),
  the module and functions called by the script (bayesian_functions.py), as
  well as the plots (posterior_theta_figure.png) generated by the code

  In order to run this on Hyak, first obtain an interactive session with X11
  forwarding
  > qsub -I -V

  Load anaconda via
  > module load anaconda3_4.2
