TITLE:
  This is the README for assignment #6 for astro 598 bayesian statistics

SYNOPSIS:
  In the provided folder is the python script to be run on hyak (hw6_script.py),
  the module and functions called by the script (bayesian_functions_hw6.py), as
  well as the plots generated by the code

  In order to run this on Hyak, first obtain an interactive session with X11
  forwarding
  > qsub -I -V

  Load anaconda via
  > module load anaconda3_4.2

  Run the script
  > python ./hw6_script.py

  Limitations: The histogram functionality in matplotlib is very sensitive to
  the range and binsize put forth in the script.
  
  Requirements: Python 3, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy

README ANSWERS:

  See figures for plots

  b) (P(x**2) has the greatest values near 0 (onesided, P increases as you
  approach 0 from the right))

  d) (P(m) has the greatest values near 0 (symmetric around 0, appears similar
  to a gaussian distribution))

  f) (P(sigma) has the greatest values near log(sigma_max), which in this case
  is approximately 9.2)
