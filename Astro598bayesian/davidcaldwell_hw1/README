TITLE:
  This is the README for assignment #1 for astro 598 bayesian statistics

SYNOPSIS:
  In the provided folder is the python script to be run on hyak (hw_script.py),
  the module and functions called by the script (coinflip.py), as well as the
  plots to answer part A, B, C. Each plot is labelled by its p, N, and M value,
  as follows histogram_p_VAL_N_VAL_M_VAL

  In order to run this on Hyak, first obtain an interactive session with X11
  forwarding
  > qsub -I -V

  Load anaconda via
  > module load anaconda3_4.2

  Run the script
  > python ./hw_script.py

  Limitations: finicky histogram plotting with bin sizing

README ANSWERS:

Part a)
The name of the probability distribution of heads is the binomial distribution.
See histogram_p_0.2_N_1000_M_5000

Part b)

Choice of M = 1000
The histogram starts to look "good" and like the binomial distribution around
M = 1000.

See histogram_p_0.3_N_(8,16,32,64,128)_M_1000

Part c)

As N increases, the histogram starts looking like a Gaussian distribution

See histogram_p_0.3_N_(10,100,1000,10000)_M_1000
