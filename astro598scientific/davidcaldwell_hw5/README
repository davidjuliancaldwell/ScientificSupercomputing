Why the need for wait command?
	We need to issue the wait command to serve as a barrier in parallel
	computing in order to make sure that each call to the sumrange function 
	completes before the reducesumrange function is called. If this were not
	the case, and reducesumrange was called before all of the sumrange
	executions were complete, the program would fail upon trying to open,
	read, and compute the necessary sum from all of the output files
	from the sumrange functions
How to runsumrange, reducesumrange, myscript.pbs
	All files (runsumrange, reducesumrange, myscript.pbs) must be in the
	designated working directory (in this case
	/gscratch/gridlab/djcald/astro598). The calls to the python functions
	in myscript.pbs are preceded by ./ , and the #!/usr/bin/python at the 
	beginning of the python call functions must point to python for 
	the functions to be carried out. 

	the function is called by 
	qsub myscript.pbs
	The output file is created in the same working directory
