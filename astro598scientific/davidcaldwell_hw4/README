NAME
	sumall

SYNOPSIS
	./sumall
	./ indicates the path in Unix for the file to be run

DESCRIPTION
	./sumall 
	sumall sums all integers from 1 to MAX (inclusive). A file
	checkpoint.out is created where each newline contains all of the
	intermediate values of the index variable i and the partial sum to 
	that point, where i is divisble by 2. 

	When run, sumall checks to first see if there is a existing file
	named checkpoint.out. If checkpoint.out exists, it is opened and 
	appended to. If it does not exist, it is created. The program has a
	one second delay in each iteration of its sum loop, and is able
	to be interrupted and restarted.

ENVIRONMENT
	requires python (looks in #!/bin/python)
	requires sumall python file in current working directory

BUGS
	none known at this time
