NAME
	generatelist
	sortlist

SYNOPSIS
	./generatelist n
	./sortlist n

	n is the number of numbers to be generated or read in
	./ indicates the path in Unix for the file to be run

DESCRIPTION
	Given n as input to generatelist, n random integers between
	1 and 100 will be generated. This can be piped via | in the 
	Unix command line to sortlist, which will then sort n number 
	of the integers piped into it. This can then be piped via |
	into the unix command uniq to print out (stdout) the uniq 
	integers, in sorted order, from sortedlist

	sortlist can also have input from stdin. If there exists a file
	with integers in it on each line e.g.
	1
	3
	4
	5

	then, cat filename | ./sortlist n will sort n integers from the
	list

ENVIRONMENT
	Requires python

BUGS
	must be run with ./ in front of generatelist and sortlist
	python must be in #!/bin/python. otherwise, the user should 
	alter this line for their own use

	if the n given to generatelist is smaller than the n given to
	sortlist, ./generatelist 5 | ./generatelist 10, then only 5 
	will be printed from generatelist
