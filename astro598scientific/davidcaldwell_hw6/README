INSTRUCTIONS 
	These are the instructions to run sumrange, reducesumrange, and myscript.pbs. 
	
	sumrange, reducesumrange, and myscript.pbs, and myworkfile  should exist in the working directory on the cluster. Python should be installed. "makemyworkfile"
	is a python script that can be run by ./makemyworkfile to generate the "myworkfile" text file that is required for myscript.pbs. 

	The myscript.pbs should be submitted as "qsub myscript.pbs". The script requires pointing to the correct hyak group and user, as well as 16 core nodes. If 8 or 12
	node cores are required, this must be changed.
