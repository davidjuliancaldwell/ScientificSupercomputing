INSTRUCTIONS
    These are instructions to use myprogram.py and stack.py
    Change to the working directory where myprogram.py and stack.py are located.
    Ensure #!/usr/bin/python in the beginning of the program  points to an appropriate python installation on Hyak
    Obtain an interactive hyak session via qsub -I
    Once on a compute node, run the program as ./myprogram.py
    If there are issues running the program, make sure there are executable permissions on the file.
    This can be done with chmod +x myprogram.py to add executable permissions.
    If an error of python^M: bad interpreter comes about, it could be an issue with
    the format of the file for unix. Do dos2unix myprogram.py to make sure it is in
    appropriate format for Hyak.
    This program initializes a blank stack, and then pushes ten random integers 
    (values between 1 and 1000) to the stack.
    The program then pops an integer off the stack and prints it.
    These integers are printed in reverse order from that in which they were pushed onto the stack.
