INSTRUCTIONS:
    These are instructions to use myprogram.py and a BinarySearchTree class.
    Change to the working directory where myprogram.py, Node.py, and BinarySearchTree.py are located.
    Ensure #!/usr/bin/python in the beginning of the program  points to an appropriate python installation on Hyak
    Obtain an interactive hyak session via qsub -I
    Once on a compute node, run the program as ./myprogram.py
    If there are issues running the program, make sure there are executable permissions on the file.
    This can be done with chmod +x myprogram.py to add executable permissions.
    If an error of python^M: bad interpreter comes about, it could be an issue with
    the format of the file for unix. Do dos2unix myprogram.py to make sure it is in
    appropriate format for Hyak.
    This program initializes a blank Binary Search Tree, with the following methods:
    .insert(i)
    .find(i)
    .traverse()
    .minBST
    .maxBST
    .size()
    .isEmpty()
    

    One hundred random integers between 1 and 10000 are put into the Binary Search Tree. 
    The program then uses the traverse method to traverse the Binary Search Tree.
    These integers are printed in the SORTED ORDER.
