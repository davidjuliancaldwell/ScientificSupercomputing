INSTRUCTIONS
    These are instructions to use myprogram.py and priorityQueue.py
    Change to the working directory where myprogram.py and priorityQueue.py are located.
    Ensure #!/usr/bin/python in the beginning of the program  points to an appropriate python installation on Hyak
    Obtain an interactive hyak session via qsub -I
    Once on a compute node, run the program as ./myprogram.py
    If there are issues running the program, make sure there are executable permissions on the file.
    This can be done with chmod +x myprogram.py to add executable permissions.
    If an error of python^M: bad interpreter comes about, it could be an issue with
    the format of the file for unix. Do dos2unix myprogram.py to make sure it is in
    appropriate format for Hyak.
    This program initializes a blank Priority Queue, with the following methods:
    .insert(i)
    .delMin()
    .minimum()
    .size()
    .isEmpty()
    .isFull()

    Twenty random integers between 1 and 1000 are put into the Priority Queue. 
    The program then using the delMin method to take off the top, minimum element
    from the Priority Queue.
    These integers are printed in the SORTED ORDER.
