TITLE:
	This is the README for assignment #5 for astro 598 monte carlo methods

SYNOPSIS:
	In the provided folder is the python file to generate the plot of interest,
	as well as a composite plot showing differing values of delta, x_initial, and N.

    Of interest is that for small deltas, the entire distribution is unable to 
    be sampled. Only the case with delta = 10 recreates the entire distribution.

	In order to run this on Hyak, first obtain an interactive session qsub -I -V. 
	Load anaconda via 
	>> module load anaconda_2.3

	Then, run the program and visualize the plots as follows:
	>> python hw5.py
