TITLE:
	This is the README for assignment #4 for astro 598 monte carlo methods

SYNOPSIS:
	In the provided folder is the python file (hw4.py) to generate the plots of interest,
	as well as a plot. The problem considered is that of doing Monte Carlo integration
    for a 4-D sphere of unit radius for various number of Monte Carlo points, 
    and seeing how that affects the accuracy of the integration. 

	The numpy  uniform random number generator is employed. 10^6,10^7,10^8,and 10^9
    points are considered. The monte carlo integration is run 10 times for each
    number of points, and the average and standard deviation from these 10 runs
    are computed for each set of N points. A plot with error bars is then created.

	In order to run this on Hyak, first obtain an interactive session with 
	> qsub -I -V

	Load anaconda via
	> module load anaconda_2.4

	Then, run the program and visualize the plots as follows:
	> python ./hw4.py
