TITLE:
	This is the README for assignment #3 for astro 598 monte carlo methods

SYNOPSIS:
	In the provided folder is the python file (hw3.py) to generate the plots of interest,
	as well as two plots. The two problems considered are generating random numbers from 
	a Poisson distribution using the rejection method and a uniform random number generator,
	and generating random numbers for a Gaussian distribution using the Box-Muller method
	and a uniform random number generator. 

	The numpy  uniform random number generator is employed. 10^6 Points are considered, and
	of note is the close matching between the histograms with unit bin width containing the 
	random numbers generated and the total number of points * the probability density 
	functions. 

	In order to run this on Hyak, first obtain an interactive session with 
	> qsub -I -V

	Load anaconda via
	> module load anaconda_2.4

	Then, run the program and visualize the plots as follows:
	> python ./hw3.py
