Sing: desired stim waveform current (uA)
Stim: 4 channels of the stim output; for 3x3 experiment we used 3 output channels, so the first 3 channels are the active and the 4th is 0
Stm0: Slow store of the pulse amp and pulse width
Wave: ECoG stored at 1525.9 Hz

Experimental set-up:

Active electrodes: 20, 28, 36 (see electrode numbers on recon in Images folder)
**** Note: unfortunately we are not sure of the order that we plugged in these electrodes to the stim headstage.
           That is, electrode 20 may not correspond to Ch. 1 of the Stim variable. It probably does, but we forgot to record this.  
Ground electrodes: 22, 30, 38

Trials:
3x3-1
Looks like dead battery, will try and charge it for 5 minutes 
Unplugged from stim box, charging 

3x3-2
Charged for several minutes, battery seems to have low charge
1000 uA , each electrode (3 channels of stimulation) 
Pulse phase duration/width = 1 ms
1.182 seconds apart 
2.0 ms pulse trains 
60 pulses
