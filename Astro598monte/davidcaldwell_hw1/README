TITLE:
	This is the README for assignment #1 for astro 598 monte carlo methods
SYNOPSIS:
	In the provided folder are a number of functions, plots, and functions to 
	recreate the analysis shown. the poissonPDF.py and gaussianPDF.py functions
	are respectively the  probability mass function, and probability distribution function
	, for the discrete poisson distribution and the continuous gaussian distribution.
	CumulativePoisson and CumulativeGaussian are the cumulative distribution functions.
	All four were verified against the scipy implementations for accuracy. 

	To run both problem 1 and problem 2 on Hyak, navigate to the directory of interest on
	Hyak. Acquire an interactive session with qsub -I . Run the scripts as:

	the functions provided run as follows 
	
	Load python:
	>>python
	
	Import modules:
	
	import CumulativeGaussian
	import poissonPDF

	Utilize the functions

	poissonPDF.poissonPDF(3,4)
	CumulativeGaussian(3,4,5)



PROBLEM 1:
	(c): The meaning of CumulativePoisson(lambda,m1)-CumulativePoisson(lambda,m2), assuming
	m1 to be greater than m2, is the probability that X lies in the closed interval between 
	m1 and m2

	(d): The approximate value of CumulativePoisson(lambda,int(100*lambda)), would be 1.
	This is because as one goes past 3*lambda, the CDF is greater than 0.99. 

	(e) The meaning of 1 - CumulativePoisson(lambda,m) is the probability of getting a 
	value n which is GREATER than m.

	(f) Lambda is known as the event rate, or the rate parameter (wikipedia). Lambda is the
	average number of events in a given interval. Lambda is also the epxected value and 
	variance for a poisson distribution 

PROBLEM 2:
	(c): mu is the mean (or expected value of the distribution). Sigma is the standard 
	deviation of the distribution, while sigma^2 is the variance.
