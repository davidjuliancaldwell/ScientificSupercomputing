TITLE:
	This is the README for assignment #2 for astro 598 monte carlo methods

SYNOPSIS:
	In the provided folder is the python file to generate the plots of interest,
	as well as the 4 plots of interest. Two cases are considered for the Gaussian PDF 
	and the Poisson PDF. One is  where the total number of points is 10**6, and the
	other is where the total number of points is 100. The library functions from numpy
	for the normal and poisson distribution are used to generate a set number of points,
	which are visualized using a histogram of unit bin size. Superimposed on each of these
	cases is the function N*P(n) for the Poisson distribution, and N*P(x) for the Gaussian
	distribution.

	Of interest is that for a large number of points (N = 10**6), the histograms and N*P(N)
	or N*P(x) very closely match. For small N's, there is less similarity.

	In order to run this on Hyak, first obtain an interactive session qsub -I -V. 
	Load anaconda via 
	>> module load anaconda_2.3

	Then, run the program and visualize the plots as follows:
	>> python hw2.py
